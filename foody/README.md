Searching recipes app built with ReactJS

# **_Foody_**

This project is created to solidify my knowledge of ReactJS.

## **_UX_**

### **_Strategy / Site Owner story_**

I have designed this app to allow the User to search for food recipes.

### **_Scope_**

Feature implemented :

-   Easy design and navigation.
-   Mobile first design.
-   Ability for any User to search products.
-   The API in used can only accept 10 request per minute.

### **_Skeleton_**

-   The website will be easy to navigate.
-   The recipes are displayed in a card style design.
-   The ingredients composing the recipes are available by clicking the "Show Ingredient" button.

-   The User will be able to search the recipes by using the search bar.

### **_Surface_**

I have used CSS Modules Stylesheet to style the application. The decision came as I find ReactJS CSS Modules Stylesheet extremely handy and easy to use. For more information please visit the DOCS here https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/.

The color used for the app background is #b6bbaf.

The color used for the card background is #a1cca0.

The color used for the button is #e3fa8e.

The color used for the button on hover is #fcb354.

The fonts chosen are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 'IBM Plex Mono' and as a back up 'sans-serif'.
